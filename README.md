# Ryu

This project contains a C and a Java implementation of Ryu, an algorithm to
quickly convert floating point numbers to decimal strings.

The Java implementations are RyuFloat and RyuDouble under src/main/java/. The
C implementation is in the ryu/ directory. Both cover 32 and 64-bit floating
point numbers.
